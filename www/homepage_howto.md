## Data contents

The app allows exploring:

- **Gene-level expression**: normalised transcript counts across developmental stages and cell types.
- **Allelic bias**: parent-of-origin-specific expression (e.g. imprinted genes).
- **PCA data**: dimensionality-reduced representations of expression patterns across samples.

## How to use this app

- **PCA** (this page): view sample-level expression trends coloured by cell type, stage, or genotype. 
  - Use the download button to retrieve PCA coordinates and explained variance (this will include all principal components, not just the first 2 plotted here).
- **Gene plots panel**: enter a gene name or Ensembl ID to view its expression profile across cell types and stages, and visualise allele-specific bias. 
  - Gene aliases and a link to the Ensembl summary are also shown.
  - A download button becomes available once plots are generated.
