## Using this app

- **PCA** (this page): view sample-level expression trends coloured by cell type, stage, or genotype. 
  - Use the download button to retrieve PCA coordinates and explained variance (this will include all principal components, not just the first 2 plotted here).
- **Gene plots panel**: enter a gene name or Ensembl ID to view its expression profile across cell types and stages, and visualise allele-specific bias. 
  - Gene aliases and a link to the Ensembl summary are also shown.
  - A download button becomes available once plots are generated.

## Usage limits and data access

This app has a limit of **25 active hours per month**. 
If the app becomes temporarily unavailable, access will resume at the start of the next calendar month.
